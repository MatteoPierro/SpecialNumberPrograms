    feat : Added implementation of __ Program in __ language ‚ù§.
    ```
    Note : *Commit only 1 implementation at a time.*
6. Open and submit a PR. üéâüéâ

## Code Standard

While writing a code
* Follow the coding standards of the language.
* Do not write the main function.
* Just write code for a function which returns whether the number is _special or not.
* _**Only if**_ the language requires to build a class, make it by the same name as of number.
* For example, see the implementation of ArmstrongNumber below.

```java
# Java 
public class ArmstrongNumber {

    public static boolean isArmstrongNumber(long num) {
        if (num < 0)
            return false;
        .
        .
        .

        return sum == num;
    }

}
```

## Considerations

* If it is some special algorithm to work on a number, then comment the name of that algorithm on top of your program.
* While adding another type of number, note that the number should **not be very complex** from an Interview POV.
* While adding another implementation language, create the folder and **update the readMe** as well.
* While adding another implementation of already present number, then its Time Complexity must be better \[provide comparison in the PR\].
* Not maintaining Community Standards anywhere will lead to a ban.
