## Considerations

* If it is some special algorithm to work on a number, then comment the name of that algorithm on top of your program.

* While adding another type of number, not that the number should **not be very complex** from an Interview POV.

* While adding another implementation language, create the folder and **update the readMe** as well.

* While adding another implementation of already present number, then its Time complexity must be better.
